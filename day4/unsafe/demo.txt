I. Create different arrays or slices of different data types. 
    1. check if slices are equal using deepequal in reflection
    2. Sizeof any slices
    3. Number of elements in the array or slices
    4. reverse the given array 

II. Create a structure of PES with the following data vals: 
    a. Courses offered
    b. Rank
    c. Location

    1. Access the structure members
    2. Find the size of structure
    3. Perform Alignof and Offsetof the struct members

III. Create an embedded structure - Company{name, location}
    1. Access the embedded structure members.
    2. Access structure members
    3. Accessing structure members randomly.
    4. Find the structure members are equal or not (deepequal)
    
IV. Create a string "Go programming" and a string "GoLang".
    1. Perform copy and find valueOf (reflection methods)
